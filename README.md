# wm-devcon-python - Visual Studio Code devcontainer for Python

## Sample Dev Container file(s) for Python in VS Code Containerized Development

*assumptions*: Docker and VS Code installed as well as the Dev Containers extension for Visual Studio Code.

*usage*: clone the repo then open in Visual Studio Code.

*example*:  clone the repo; open a new VS Code window; open the directory containing this repo; when prompted, choose Reopen in Container. 

I chose to use a Ubuntu base and install `pyenv` to allow multiple version of Python.
